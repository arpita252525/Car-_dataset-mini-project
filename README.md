# Car Dataset Mini Project 🚗📊

This repository contains a mini project focused on analyzing a **car price dataset** using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn). The goal is to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and extract useful insights about car prices and their influencing factors.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Car_dataset_Minipro.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis and visualizations.
* `car_price_dataset.csv` → Dataset used for the project (make sure to include/upload it).

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  ```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-dataset-miniproject.git
   cd car-dataset-miniproject
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Car_dataset_Minipro.ipynb
   ```

   *(Or upload it to Google Colab and update the dataset path if needed)*

3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis.

## 📊 Key Features

* Import and explore the car dataset.
* Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.).
* Analyze car price trends.
* Visualize data with charts and graphs.
* Answer questions like:

  * What is the average car price?
  * Which brand has the highest average price?
  * What’s the most common fuel type?
  * Distribution of transmission types.

## 📝 Insights & Results

This project helps understand how different factors such as **brand, fuel type, mileage, and transmission** affect car pricing.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add more advanced visualizations.
* Implement predictive models (e.g., regression).
* Deploy an interactive dashboard.

Do you want me to also include **badges (Python, Jupyter, License, etc.)** and a **screenshot of your output graphs** in the README? That would make it more professional for GitHub.
